        Moonzia, a little moon with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes, was searching for her best friend, Shinnyshine. Shinnyshine, a shooting star with a trail of shimmering stardust, was a whirlwind of excitement, always zipping across the night sky. But lately, Shinnyshine had vanished, and Moonzia was worried.
        
        She peeked down at Earth, her silvery glow illuminating the sleeping world. Suddenly, she spotted something sparkling – stardust! It wasn’t just any stardust, though. This stardust was scattered on top of the most delicious-looking gingerbread houses in a little candy store window.
        Moonzia’s heart leaped. “Shinnyshine!” she whispered. “You mischievous star, you’ve been here!”
        
        Excitedly, she floated down to Earth, her light guiding her to the candy store. Inside, the air was sweet with the smell of gingerbread and frosting. A kind baker with flour dusting his apron smiled at her.
        
        “Hello,” Moonzia said, “Have you seen my friend? She’s a shooting star, and she leaves a trail of stardust wherever she goes.”
        
        The baker chuckled. “A shooting star? Why, yes! A lovely young star came in a few days ago. She was quite the baker! Made the most magnificent gingerbread house. And look!” He pointed to a particularly sparkly gingerbread house. “She even sprinkled stardust on it!”
        
        Moonzia gasped. It was beautiful! The gingerbread house was decorated with shimmering stars, glittering moon crescents, and even a tiny candy ladder for the moon to climb.
        
        “Would you like to learn how to make a gingerbread house?” the baker offered, his eyes twinkling.
        
        Moonzia, still a little sad that she missed her friend, nodded eagerly. The baker patiently showed her how to mix the dough, cut out the walls and roof, and bake the gingerbread pieces until they were golden brown.
        
        Then came the fun part – decorating! Moonzia learned to pipe frosting like a pro, creating intricate swirls and delicate designs. She added colorful candies, gumdrops, and, of course, a generous sprinkle of stardust. Her gingerbread house turned out even more magical than she could have imagined.
        
        Feeling a little happier, Moonzia thanked the baker and continued her search for Shinnyshine. She knew her friend was out there, somewhere in the vast universe, leaving a trail of stardust and spreading joy wherever she went. And Moonzia, with her own little gingerbread house as a reminder of their friendship, knew she would find her again soon.

        content: '''
        On a beautiful sunny day, a fox was strolling along, deep in thought about his foxy affairs. He decided it would be best to enjoy his lunch under the shade of a tree. After all, he was quite hungry and thirsty.
        
        However, to his dismay, he realized he had forgotten his delicious lunch at home!
        
        “How could I have been so forgetful?” he exclaimed.
        
        Suddenly, his eyes fell upon a sight that made him forget his troubles. Hanging from a branch above, swaying gently in the breeze, were the most magnificent grapes he had ever seen! They were plump, juicy, and glistening in the sunlight. The fox’s mouth watered at the sight.
        
        “I must have those grapes!” he declared. “Just one bite of that sweet fruit…”
        
        But the grapes hung high on the branch, well beyond his reach. He leaped and stretched, but to no avail. He backed up, ran, and jumped again, but still, the grapes remained tantalizingly out of reach.
        
        Exhausted and frustrated after numerous failed attempts, he collapsed beneath the tree.
        
        “What a foolish fox I am!” he grumbled. “Jumping and straining for these sour grapes on this hot day! Who even wants these sour grapes anyway?”
        
        With a flick of his tail, the fox turned and headed home, defeated.
        
        And so, dear children, remember that sometimes, when we can’t have something, we may try to convince ourselves that we didn’t want it in the first place. Just like our friend the fox!

        content: """All the animals in the forest knew that the hare is the fastest among them. He could run through long roads without any hard effort.
        
        One day, the hare saw a tortoise who was laboriously making his way in the forest. The hare stopped and started mocking the poor tortoise:
        
        OH! you’ve got such short feet and a heavy shell! You must be the slowest animal in all the forest! I think it’s possible for you to fall asleep when you are walking!
        
        The tortoise was not offended by the hare’s words. Slowly, she continued to put one foot in front of the other.
        
        I really have to look very closely to tell if you are moving or standing still. How long does it take you to walk ten yards? A whole day? The hare continued the rude laugh!
        
        And then he put his hands on his belly and burst out laughing. In that very moment, the tortoise stopped and smirked:
        
        Go ahead and make fun of me! Until this day, I have always managed to arrive at my destination. And when I think about it carefully, I even think that it’s possible for me to beat you in a race!
        
        The hare passed out from laughing when he heard this! After a few moments, when he finally succeeded to stop the laugh, he said:
        
        OK! I agree! So I’ll see you in competition day!
        
        The two quickly agreed on the fox as the referee and met a day later by a brich tree. They decide to assign the starting point of the race to the tree. The fox announced.
        
        Whoever arrives first at the big pond has won the race! Are you ready? Three, two, one – go!
        
        The hair jumped as a lightning and disappeared after a few seconds. After a short time he had already finished half the race. He turned around and found that the tortoise had only took a few steps. He whispered:
        
        Ok! It’s an easy one! I have got plenty of time left! I can go to the carrot field for a short trip.
        
        Then he hobbled straight to the big field and nibbled a few carrots with relish. When he returned, he saw that the tortoise is still close to the starting line. He was trying to walk with difficulty and make his way! He souted:
        
        Oh you lazy! try harder! Come on!
        
        All the birds and animals were cheering for the hare! Prompted by the applause of the audience, the hare performed several tricks and daredevil jumps.
        
        But those carrots and doing tricks made him exhausted. So just before the finish line, he lay down in the grass and took a nap! And the nap turned into a deep sleep!
        
        Suddenly, he woke up from that sweet sleep by loud cheers and applause. He opened his eyes and could hardly believe what he saw. The turtle set foot over the finish line and had won the race.
        
        The fox shouted:
        
        Congratulations, dear turtle. You have won the race!
        
        All the animals of the forest congratulated the turtle and celebrated the incredible victory together with him!""",

Dorothy went home to be safe from the tornado, but the tornado was coming straight towards their house. Dorothy looked out the window and then ducked under the table. Dorothy screamed for help but no one could hear her.

The tornado took Dorothy’s cabin and her dog with it and left it on the ground in a strange land. Dorothy slowly opened the door and looked outside. She had never seen it before. Suddenly a voice said to her,

“Welcome to the land of Oz, lady.” She saw a fairy with wings.

“I want to come with you to get courage from the Wizard of Oz. I want to be a brave lion,”

They went and went until they reached a valley. Dorothy said sadly, what should we do now? The scarecrow saw a tree by the side of the valley and said to his friends:

“I have an idea. If the Tin man cuts down that tree, we can throw the tree trunk over the valley.” Let’s cross it like a bridge.

Everyone liked the idea of ​​the scarecrow. The Tin man did the same thing and the tree fell on the door. The lion said:

let me cross first. If there is no danger, you can also cross. The lion crossed the bridge and when there was no problem, the others followed him. became

Everyone went and went until they reached the city of Oz. The city was green. The city gate officer gave each of them a pair of glasses so that the green light of the city wouldn’t bother them. Then he guided them to the great wizard’s room.

“You are a bad, ugly, wicked witch.” T

Oz said: I will fulfill all your wishes.

He came out from behind the curtain and said:

About the scarecrow, I must say that he has a brain but he doesn’t know about it. If he didn’t think, how did he know that he can build a bridge with a tree.

        title: "The Firebird and the Grey Wolf!",
        author: "Russia fairy tale",
        reference: "moonzia.com",
         genre: "Fairy Tale",
        content: """In a faraway kingdom, there was a tsar named Vyslav Andronovich. He had three sons: Dmitry, Vasily, and the youngest, Ivan. The tsar owned a garden so grand that there was no garden in any country in the world that could compare with it. In the middle of the garden stood his most precious tree, one that grew golden apples.

But then a Firebird became a regular visitor to Tsar Vyslav's garden; it had golden feathers, and its eyes were like oriental crystals. This magical bird flew to the garden every night and sat on Tsar Vyslav's favourite apple tree. It sat for a while, lighting up the garden with a golden glow, before nibbling at some apples. The Firebird then plucked a particularly large one, gripped it tightly in its talons, and flew away.

Tsar Vyslav became more and more upset, because every night he lost more and more of his golden apples. Eventually he called his three sons to him and said:

“My dear children, which of you can catch the Firebird in my garden? Whoever succeeds shall have half my kingdom now and the rest when I am gone.”

His children, the princes, cried out with one voice:
“Dear father, your royal majesty! We will do our utmost to catch the Firebird alive!”
On the first night, Prince Dmitry went to keep watch in the garden and sat under the apple tree from which the Firebird was picking apples. Unfortunately he fell asleep and did not hear how the magical bird flew in and picked a great many apples. In the morning, Tsar Vyslav Andronovich called his son Dmitry to him:

“Well, my dear son, have you seen the Firebird or not?”

Dmitry answered:

“No, my dear lord-father! She did not fly in last night.”

The next night, Prince Vasily went into the garden to watch for the Firebird. He sat under the same apple tree and, after sitting for an hour or two, fell soundly asleep. He too did not hear the Firebird fly in and nibble on the apples. In the morning, Tsar Vyslav called him and asked:

“Well, my dear son, have you seen the Firebird or not?”

“Dear sir-father! She did not fly in last night.”

On the third night, Prince Ivan went into the garden to keep watch and sat under the same apple tree. He sat there for an hour, then another, and then another. Suddenly the whole garden lit up as if by a great star! The Firebird flew in, sat on the apple tree and began to pluck the apples. Ivan crept up to it so skillfully that he grabbed it by the tail. However, he wasn’t able to hold on to it. The Firebird broke free and flew away. Ivan was left with only one feather from the tail in his hand. In the morning, as soon as Tsar Vyslav awoke from his sleep, Ivan gave him a feather from the Firebird. Tsar Vyslav was very happy that his youngest son managed to get at least one feather from the Firebird. This feather was so wonderful and bright that if you brought it into a dark room, it would shine as if a great many candles were lit in that room. Tsar Vyslav put that feather in his study as a thing that should be kept forever. After losing a feather, the Firebird did not fly into the garden again.

Tsar Vyslav again called his children to him and said to them:
“My dear children! Go on a journey, find the Firebird and bring it to me alive; and as I promised before, the one who brings the Firebird to me will receive half of my kingdom.”

Dmitry and Vasily were already jealous of their younger brother Ivan, because he had managed to pull a feather from the tail of the Firebird. They took a blessing from their father and went off together to find the magical bird. And Ivan also began to ask his father for a blessing for this. Tsar Vyslav said to him:

“My dear son, my dear child! You are still young and not used to such a long and difficult journey. Why leave me? What if all three of you do not return for a long time? I am already old. What if God, in his wisdom, calls to the next world while you are gone? The kingdom will be left without a ruler.”
But try as he might, he could not dissuade young Ivan from trying his hand at finding the Firebird, and he too set out on his way.
Along his journey, Ivan came to a sign with three directions: straight ahead promised hunger and cold, the right promised to cost him his horse but spare his life, and the left threatened to take his life but spare his horse. Ivan chose the right path.

After riding for many days, a great grey wolf jumped out in front of weary Ivan.
“Oh, you Goy!” said the Wolf, which is something like, “Your Highness!” Did you not read the sign that said you would lose your horse if you came this way?”

“I did, sir Wolf,” replied Ivan. “But it was better than freezing to death or losing my life.”
And as soon as he said those words, the horse threw him to the ground and ran off.
Ivan was very sad about his horse. But this was no time to cry! He continued on foot, incredibly tired and longing to sit down to rest. Then the grey wolf caught up with him and said:

“ I feel sorry for you, Ivan, that you are exhausted on foot. Climb on my back, and tell me where to take you!”
Ivan explained his quest for the Firebird. The grey wolf knew exactly where to go. He rushed faster than a horse. By the start of night, he brought Ivan to a stone wall that was not very high, stopped and said:

“Well, Ivan, we’ve arrived. Time to slip off my back and climb over this stone wall. There is a garden behind the wall, and in that garden the Firebird sits in a golden cage. You take the Firebird, but do not touch the golden cage. If you take the cage, you will not be able to escape from the garden. You will be caught immediately!”

Ivan climbed over the stone wall into the garden, saw the Firebird in a golden cage, gleaming and lighting up the whole garden. He took the shining bird out of the cage and went back. But just as he was about to climb out of the garden, he said to himself: "Why did I take the Firebird without a cage, where shall I put it?" He returned and as soon as he took off with the golden cage, there was a dreadful knocking and thunder throughout the garden. The guards immediately woke up, ran into the garden, and caught Ivan with the Firebird. They brought him to their king, whose name was Dolmat. King Dolmat became very angry with Ivan and shouted at him in a loud and angry voice:

“Aren't you ashamed of stealing, young man! Who are you, where are you from, and who is your father?”
Ivan said to him:
“I am from the kingdom of Vyslav, and my name is Ivan. The Tsar is my father. Your Firebird flew into our garden every night, and plucked golden apples from my father's favourite apple tree. For this reason my father sent me to find the Firebird and bring it to him.”
“Well You have gone the wrong way about it!” said King Dolmat, angrily. “But I shall give you a chance if you do me a favour. Go to the thrice-nine lands, and fetch me a golden-maned horse from Tsar Afron. If you do this, I will forgive you and give you the Firebird with great honour. But if you fail to do this favour, then I will let all the world know that you are a dishonest thief!”

Ivan left King Dolmat in great shame, promising to fetch the golden-maned horse.
“Oh, you goy, young man, Ivan son of the Tsar!” - the grey wolf said to him. “Why did you not listen to me? Why did you take the golden cage?”

“I am guilty before you,” Ivan said to the wolf.
“Very well, so be it!” said the grey wolf. “Climb on my back. I will take you where you need to go.”

Prince Ivan sat on the grey wolf's back and the wolf ran as fast as an arrow. They finally reached the kingdom of Tsar Afron at night. And, having come to the white-stone royal stables, the grey wolf said to Prince Ivan:
“Go now to these white-stone stables. The grooms on guard are all fast asleep! Take the golden-maned horse. When you see a golden bridle hanging on the wall, do not take it, or it will be bad for you.”

Ivan crept into the white-stone stables, took his horse and was about to escape. Then he saw a golden bridle on the wall and was so tempted by it that he took it off the nail. As soon as he did this, there was thunder and noise throughout the stables. The grooms woke up, came running, caught Ivan and led him to Tsar Afron. Tsar Afron began to ask him:

“Oh, you goy, young man! Tell me your country, your father, and your name.”

To this Ivan answered him:

“I myself am from the kingdom of Vyslav, the son of Tsar Vyslav, and my name is Prince Ivan.”

“Well, Prince Ivan, you have done wrong. But I will give you this chance. Fetch me Princess Elena the Beautiful. I have long loved her with my soul and heart. Do me this favour and I shall forgive you and give you the golden bridle with honour.. But if you do not do me this favour, then I will let all the world know that you are a dishonest thief!”
Then Ivan promised Tsar Afron to fetch the princess Elena the Beautiful, and felt ashamed at what he had done.

“Oh, you goy, young man, Ivan son of the Tsar!” - the grey wolf said to him. “Why did you not listen to me? Why did you take the golden bridle?”

“I am guilty before you,” Ivan said to the wolf.

“Very well, so be it!” - said the grey wolf. “Climb on my back. I will take you where you need to go.”

The grey wolf once again carried Ivan on his back and ran swiftly, covering vast distances in a short time. At last, they reached the kingdom where Princess Elena the Beautiful lived. A golden fence surrounded her wondrous garden, and the wolf stopped just outside it.
“Now, Ivan,” said the grey wolf, “you must follow my instructions carefully. I will leap over this fence and capture Princess Elena myself. You wait for me here under this oak tree, and when I return, you must not hesitate. Jump on my back immediately, and we shall make our escape.”

Ivan agreed. The wolf leapt gracefully over the golden fence and waited in hiding until evening, when Princess Elena came into the garden with her attendants. As soon as she approached, the wolf darted out, seized her gently but firmly, and bounded back over the fence

“Quick Ivan!” the wolf called. “Jump onto me now!”

Ivan climbed onto the wolf's back, and they sped away with Princess Elena. Despite the commotion raised in the palace, no one could catch them, and soon they were far from the kingdom. As they travelled, Ivan and Elena began to talk, and before long, they had fallen deeply in love.

When they neared the kingdom of Tsar Afron, Ivan became sorrowful. “How can I give up the princess I now love with all my heart?” he lamented.

The grey wolf, ever loyal, comforted him. “Do not despair, Ivan. I will transform myself into the likeness of Princess Elena. Take me to Tsar Afron. He will be very pleased and let you have the golden mained Horse… little will he realise that his beautiful bride is a gray wolf in disguise!”

Ivan was delighted with this plan. He climbed down from the Gray Wolf’s back and then, all of a sudden, there were not one, but two Princess Elena’s standing before him. Now that was magic! He escorted the one who was really the wolf in disguise to Tsar Afron. Tsar Afron was delighted and happily exchanged the horse with the golden main and the golden bridle for the princess. Then Ivan returned to where he had left the real princess Elena and lifted her onto the horse with the golden main. They travelled to the court of King Dolmat who happily exchanged the Firebird for the horse, and at last they set off for home!
But on the way they ran into his brothers, Dmitry and Vasily, who were furious to see that their little brother Ivan was returning not only with the Firebird but with a beautiful princess too. They drew their swords and were about to attack their little brother when the grey wolf jumped out of the bushes and filled them with terror! They galloped away on their horses as fast as they could and did not dare return for a very long time.
So Ivan - without his brothers - came to his father the Tsar and presented him with the Firebird. His father was overjoyed to see him - though worried about his other sons. Ivan and Princess Elena the beautiful were married and eventually became Tsar and Tsarina of the Kingdom and lived happily ever after, while the Firebird lit up the garden at night with golden light - and only ate the apples that it was given. And as for the grey wolf he lived in the gatehouse of the palace with his wife and cubs, making sure that no thieves or bad people ever entered the grounds.

And that was the tale of the Firebird and the Gray Wolf, from Russia.

There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling waves and watching his line, all of a sudden his float was dragged away deep into the water. When he reeled in his line, he pulled out a golden fish. But the fish said, "Pray let me live! I am not a real fish. I am an enchanted prince. Put me in the water again, and let me go!"

"Oh, ho!" Said the man. "You need not go on much more about the matter. I will have nothing to do with a fish that can talk, so swim away, sir, as soon as you please!" Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him on the wave.

When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how he had caught a golden fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. "Did not you ask it for anything?" Said the wife. "We live very wretchedly here, in this nasty dirty pigsty. Do go back and tell the fish we want a snug little cottage."

The fisherman did not much like the business - however, he went to the seashore, and when he got back there the water looked all yellow and green. He stood at the water’s edge, and said,

"O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!"

Then the fish came swimming to him and said, "Well, what is her will? What does your wife want?"

"Ah!" Said the fisherman. "She says that when I caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let you go. She does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants a snug little cottage."

"Go home then," said the fish, "she is in the cottage already!" So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the door of a nice trim little cottage.

"Come in, come in!" Said she. "Is not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?" There was a parlour, a bedroom, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits. There was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. "Ah!" Said the fisherman, "How happily we shall live now!"

"We will try to do so, at least," said his wife.

Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said, "Husband, there is not nearly room enough for us in this cottage; the courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small. I should like to have a large stone castle to live in. Go to the fish again and tell him to give us a castle."

"Wife," said the fisherman, "I don’t like to go to him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this pretty cottage to live in."

"Nonsense!" Said the wife. "He will do it very willingly, I know. Go along and try!"

The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm. He went close to the edge of the waves, and said,

"O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!"

"Well, what does she want now?" said the fish.

"Ah!" Said the man, dolefully. "My wife wants to live in a stone castle."

"Go home then," said the fish, "she is standing at the gate of it already." So away went the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great castle. "See," said she, "is not this grand?" With that they went into the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables. Behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a mile long, full of sheep, goats, hares, and deer; and in the courtyard were stables and cow houses.

"Well," said the man, "now we will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of our lives."

"Perhaps we may," said the wife, "but let us sleep upon it, before we make up our minds to that." So they went to bed.The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, "Get up, husband, and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land."

"Wife, wife," said the man, "why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king."

"Then I will," said she. "But wife," said the fisherman, "how can you be king? The fish cannot make you a king?"

"Husband," said she, "say no more about it, but go and try! I will be king." So the man went away quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves and the ridges of foam as he cried out,

"O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!"

"Well, what would she have now?" Said the fish. "Alas!" Said the poor man. "My wife wants to be king."

"Go home," said the fish, "she is king already."

Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. When he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds, with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six fair maidens, each a head taller than the other.
"Well, wife," said the fisherman, "are you king?"

"Yes," said she, "I am king." And when he had looked at her for a long time, he said, "Ah, wife! what a fine thing it is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long as we live."

"I don’t know how that may be," said she. "Never is a long time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I think I should like to be emperor."

"Alas, wife! Why should you wish to be emperor?" Said the fisherman. "Husband," said she, "go to the fish! I say I will be emperor."

"Ah, wife!" Replied the fisherman. "The fish cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for such a thing."

"I am king," said Ilsabill, "and you are my slave - so go at once!" So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along, "This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done." He soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said,

"O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!"

"What would she have now?" Said the fish. "Ah!" Said the fisherman, "she wants to be emperor."

"Go home," said the fish, "she is emperor already. "So he went home again, and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on her head a full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other - from
the tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. Before her stood princes, dukes, and earls. The fisherman went up to her and said, "Wife, are you emperor?"

"Yes," said she, "I am emperor."

"Ah!" Said the man, as he gazed upon her. "What a fine thing it is to be emperor!"

"Husband," said she, "why should we stop at being emperor? I will be pope next."

"O wife, wife!" Said he, "How can you be pope? There is but one pope at a time in Christendom."

"Husband," said she, "I will be pope this very day."

"But," replied the husband, "the fish cannot make you pope."

"What nonsense!" Said she. "If he can make an emperor, he can make a pope - go and try him." So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves. The ships were in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he
trembled so that his knees knocked together. Still he went down near to the shore, and said,

"O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!"

"What does she want now?" said the fish. "Ah!" Said the fisherman. "My wife wants to be pope."

"Go home," said the fish; "she is pope already."

Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne that was two miles high. She had three great crowns on her head, and around her stood all the pomp and power of the church. On each side of her were two rows of burning lights of all sizes; the greatest as large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no larger than a small rush light. "Wife," said the fisherman, as he looked at all this greatness, "are you pope?"

"Yes," said she, "I am pope."

"Well, wife," replied he, "it is a grand thing to be pope; and now you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater."

"I will think about that," said the wife. Then they went to bed, but Dame Ilsabill could not sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. "Ha!" Thought she, as she woke up and looked at it through the window. "After all I cannot prevent the sun rising." At this thought she was very angry, and wakened her husband, and said, "Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must be lord of the sun and moon."

The fisherman was half asleep, but the thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed. "Alas, wife! Cannot you be easy with being pope?"

"No," said she, "I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my permission. Go to the fish at once!"

Then the man went shivering with fear, and as he was going down to the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks shook. All the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the lightning played, and the thunders rolled. You might have seen in the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of white foam upon their heads. The fisherman crept towards the sea, and cried out, as well as he could,

"O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a gift of thee!"

"What does she want now?" Said the fish. "Ah!" Said he. "She wants to be lord of the sun and moon."

"Go home," said the fish, "to your pigsty again."

And there they live to this very day.""",
